Windows Advanced Authorization System

* This is not an authentication library.
* This project uses Judge Dredd metaphors to implement autorizations.
* This library integrates:
    * seamlessly with Windows Standard Security;
    * prefectly with ASP.NET security;
    * without issue with anything that sets an IPrincipal to Thread.CurrentPrincipal;
    * with some work for anything else that is not Windows Standard Security.

# Usage

_While I'm editing this documentation, please consult Source code for 
detailed information, especially test cases in the MegacityOne.Tests
project. I paid special attention to document both functions and tests._
