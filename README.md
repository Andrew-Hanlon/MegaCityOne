Windows Advanced Authorization System

* This is not an authentication library.
* This project uses Judge Dredd metaphors to implement autorizations.
* This library integrates:
    * seamlessly with Windows Standard Security;
    * prefectly with ASP.NET security;
    * without issue with anything that sets an IPrincipal to Thread.CurrentPrincipal;
    * with some work for anything else that is not Windows Standard Security.
